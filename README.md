<strong>Hi</strong> <strong>Rex!</strong>

Thank you for the assignment you gave us.

My answer for the missing code is: <strong>console.log("Bond, James bond");</strong>

If my answer is incorrect, I would love to know the correct code.

Looking forward for another <em><strong>fun</strong></em> and <em><strong>exciting</strong></em> session with you. :smile:
